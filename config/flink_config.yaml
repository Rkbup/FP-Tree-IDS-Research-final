# Apache Flink cluster configuration
#
# The experiments may be executed on a local Flink mini‑cluster or a
# standalone cluster.  This configuration file provides example
# settings for both.  Modify as necessary for your environment.

jobmanager:
  # Address of the JobManager.  For a local mini‑cluster this is
  # localhost.  For a distributed cluster provide the hostname or IP
  # of the JobManager node.
  address: "localhost"
  # RPC port used by the JobManager.  Default Flink port is 6123.
  port: 6123

taskmanager:
  # Number of TaskManager slots.  Each slot allows one parallel
  # operator chain.  Increase this number to improve parallelism.
  slots: 4
  # Memory allocation for the TaskManager.  Adjust to match
  # available hardware.  Values may include units (e.g., 1024m).
  memory: "2048m"
  # JVM options for the TaskManager (optional).  Use this section
  # to tune garbage collection or debugging flags.
  # jvm_options: "-XX:+UseG1GC -Xloggc:gc.log"

pipeline:
  # Default parallelism for operators when not explicitly overridden.
  parallelism: 1
  # Restart strategy used by Flink when the job fails.  Use
  # 'none' to disable automatic restarts or set to 'fixed‑delay' or
  # 'failure‑rate' with appropriate parameters.
  restart_strategy:
    type: fixed-delay
    delay: 10000  # milliseconds between restarts
    attempts: 3
