Download and prepare the CIC-IDS2017 dataset.

This script provides a convenience function for fetching the CIC-IDS2017 data set.  In
practice, the data is hosted by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity and can
be downloaded from their servers after agreeing to the terms of use.  The
function below demonstrates how one could download a tar archive via
HTTP and extract it into the `data/raw/` directory.  If the remote host is not
reachable or requires authentication, the user must download the data manually
and place it in the appropriate directory.

Usage:

```
python download_dataset.py
```

After running, the raw dataset files will reside in `data/raw/`.
