# 🚀 START HERE - After PC Restart

**Welcome back!** PC restart করার পর এখানে থেকে শুরু করুন।

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Check Status
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Abdullah Rakib Akand\Downloads\FP-Tree-IDS-Research-final"
.\check_status.ps1
```

### Step 2: Based on Results

**If everything is running** ✅
```powershell
# Just monitor
kubectl get pods -n fp-tree
kubectl logs -f -n fp-tree fp-tree-main-experiment-rhxql
```

**If experiments need to be redeployed** 🔄
```powershell
.\deploy_experiments.ps1
```

**If Docker image is missing** 🔨
```powershell
# Rebuild image (~12 minutes)
docker build -t fp-tree-ids:latest .
# Then deploy
.\deploy_experiments.ps1
```

## ✅ What Was Accomplished Before Restart

1. ✅ Fixed dataset inclusion issue (renamed .dockerignore)
2. ✅ Built Docker image (747MB with all 8 CSV files)
3. ✅ Verified CSV files in image
4. ✅ Created Kubernetes namespace and PVC
5. ✅ Deployed both experiments (main + synthetic)
6. ✅ Verified successful startup - NO FileNotFoundError!
7. ✅ Both pods were Running and processing data

---

## 🎯 Expected Next Steps

After restart, experiments might be:
- ✅ **Still Running** → Great! Just monitor them
- 🎉 **Completed** → Extract results
- ⚠️ **Failed/Stopped** → Redeploy and restart
- ❌ **Lost** → Redeploy from scratch

**Run `check_status.ps1` to find out!**

---

## ⏱️ Time Estimates

- Status check: **< 1 minute**
- Redeployment (if needed): **5 minutes**
- Main experiment: **4-5 hours**
- Synthetic experiment: **2-3 hours**

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

### Docker Desktop won't start?
```powershell
# Check if process exists
Get-Process "*docker*"

# Restart Docker Desktop
Stop-Process -Name "Docker Desktop" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Start-Process "C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Docker Desktop.exe"
Start-Sleep -Seconds 60
docker version
```

### Image missing after restart?
```powershell
# Check if image exists
docker images fp-tree-ids

# If missing, rebuild
docker build -t fp-tree-ids:latest .
```

### Kubernetes broken?
```powershell
# Check cluster
kubectl cluster-info

# If failed, reset in Docker Desktop:
# Settings → Kubernetes → Reset Kubernetes Cluster
```

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria

You'll know everything is working when:
- ✅ `check_status.ps1` shows all green checkmarks
- ✅ `kubectl get pods -n fp-tree` shows pods Running or Completed
- ✅ Logs show no errors
- ✅ Experiments progressing through phases
