flink_connector.py
==================

This module provides a thin abstraction over Apache Flink for streaming
experiments.  In our evaluation Flink is used to manage the flow of
network transactions through the FP‑tree algorithms in a scalable and
fault‑tolerant manner.  Because Flink jobs are typically submitted via
the command line or REST APIs, the functions here serve mainly as
placeholders indicating where to integrate with Flink in a production
deployment.

When run locally without Flink, these functions can be mocked or
implemented as simple Python generators.

    This is a stub implementation.  In a real system you would use
